3. So far so good! Added the code! Was a little confused if it should be Python or javascript, but figured out by the content of the code.

3. Created the response. It was hidden and not intuitive, but after asking for help, I figured it out.

5. I tested it, and the output is not good. I am sure I've done everything as the task guided me to, yet the result is not satisfying. My collegues got similar issue.
